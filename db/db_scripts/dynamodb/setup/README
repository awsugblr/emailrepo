1. Edit the credentials file with your AWS ACCESS_KEY and SECRET_KEY
(Remember to use keys with least privileges - for eg, if only DynamoDB is required create an IAM credential with just that service)

2. Execute the setupCreds.sh
(This will copy the credentials under the ~/.aws folder where Boto3 checks for it)

3. You can now run 'aws configure' (if needed) to further customize your settings like region, output format etc...

4. After this is done, you should be able to run the ../CreateTable*.py or ../DeleteTable*.py individual scripts
(You can try the InvokeCreateTables.py or InvokeDeleteTables.py script for one shot invokation as well)
